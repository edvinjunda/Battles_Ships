  When putting ship horizontally, it will go rightwards from x y coordinates
  When putting ship vertically, it will go downwards from x y coordinates.
  Remember, place ships in a way to not collide them!

  This is how collision looks like:
  
  4 blocks ship collides with 2 blocks ship
                #
  ######    #####    ##
                       ####

  Ships have to be 1 block away from each other!

  + displays hit
  X displays that 1 block ship was shot
